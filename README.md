# Geocoding the Fliegel Index

This repository contains the source, interim and final data, as well as the source code that was used to geocode the geographic names in the documents _[Records of the Moravian Mission Among the Indians of North America: Geographic Names Index](<https://assets.cengage.com/gale/psm/3240000A.pdf>)_ and _[Records of the Moravian Mission Among the Indians of North America: White
Persons Index](<https://assets.cengage.com/gale/psm/3239000A.pdf>)_.

To reproduce the results, execute the scripts in the order of their enumeration. The GeoNames data has to be downloaded manually from <https://download.geonames.org/export/dump/> beforehand.

The authors used Python 3.11.0 with the latest versions of the libraries used (as of January 24, 2023). The GeoNames data was downloaded on January 17, 2023.
